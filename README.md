Student Management System üìö
A command-line based Student Management System built with Python that facilitates the management of student records using a MySQL database and provides basic data visualization.

‚ú® Features
This system allows you to:

Add New Student Records: Easily input details for new students including Admission Number, Roll Number, Name, Class, Section, Age, Gender, Aadhar, and SSID.

Update Student Records: Modify existing student information such as Roll Number, Class, Section, and Age based on the Admission Number.

Delete Student Records: Remove student entries from the database using their Admission Number.

Search Student Records: Find specific student details by providing their Roll Number.

View All Student Records: Display a comprehensive list of all students currently in the database.

Graphical Analysis: Visualize the number of students per class using a bar graph generated with Matplotlib.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python 3.x: The core programming language.

MySQL Database: Used for storing and managing student data.

mysql.connector: Python library to connect and interact with MySQL.

matplotlib: Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations, used here for data analysis.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get a local copy of the project up and running on your machine.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x: Download from python.org.

MySQL Server: Download and install from [suspicious link removed]. Make sure your MySQL server is running.

Python Libraries: You'll need mysql-connector-python and matplotlib.

Installation
Save the Script:
Save the provided Python code as a .py file (e.g., student_management.py).

Install Python Dependencies:
Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:

Bash

pip install mysql-connector-python matplotlib
MySQL Configuration:
The script attempts to connect to a MySQL database at localhost with user='root' and passwd='password'. It also automatically creates a database named school_db and a table named student if they don't exist.

Important: If your MySQL root user has a different password, you must change the passwd variable in the script:

Python

mycon=sqltor.connect(host='localhost',user='root',passwd='your_mysql_root_password_here' ,database='school_db')
Ensure your MySQL server is running before executing the script.

üèÉ Usage
Run the Script:
Navigate to the directory where you saved student_management.py in your terminal or command prompt and run:

Bash

python student_management.py
Interact with the Menu:
The application will present a main menu:

*************** Welcome ***************

1 : Modify Database
2 : View Database
3 : Graphical Analysis
4 : Exit
